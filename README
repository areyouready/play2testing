First steps with play2 and scala
=====================================

Just for my interest some playing around with this web framework and scala

Simple web application for CRUD operations with a couchdb.
The view contains a table that shows the sorted values from the db with a delete and a edit 
button in the last cell of every row and a search field. Clicking edit loads the 
corresponding value to a minimalistic edit form for updating. Another separate form is used
for adding new values to the DB.
When too many values are added a self implemented paging splits the table up.

Some simple JQuery code uses a search field for live filtering via AJAX.
Integrated Bootstrap3 less files.
